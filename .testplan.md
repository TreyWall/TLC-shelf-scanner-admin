# Admin Dashboard Test Plan

This document details the tests for the Shelf Scanner admin dashboard.

## Objectives

- Ensure that only authenticated administrators can access job data.
- Validate that jobs can be reviewed and their statuses updated.
- Confirm that the reports page aggregates job data correctly.
- Verify that basic UI elements render as expected.

## Manual Test Cases

| AD‑M02 | Unauthorized access | 1. Without logging in, attempt to visit `/jobs` directly. | The app redirects back to `/login`. |
| AD‑M03 | Review job approval | 1. Login as admin.<br>2. Click **Review** on a job.<br>3. Click **Approve**. | Job status updates to `approved` and user is returned to the job queue. |
| AD‑M04 | Review job rejection | 1. Login as admin.<br>2. Click **Review** on a job.<br>3. Click **Reject**. | Job status updates to `rejected` and user is returned to the job queue. |
| AD‑M05 | Reports dashboard | 1. Login as admin.<br>2. Navigate to `/reports`. | A bar chart appears showing counts of approved, rejected and pending jobs. |

## Automated Tests

The Jest test suite includes:

- **firestore.test.js** – ensures Firestore is initialised.
- **LoginPage.test.js** – checks that the login form renders correctly.

Further tests can be added to simulate route guards, data fetching and chart rendering.
